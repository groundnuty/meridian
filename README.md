Meridian connects coding clients to **Claude and Antigravity using your subscription**.
Run Pi, OpenCode or another supported client against a local API, and manage
providers, requests and usage from a browser or the optional Mac app.

Claude requests run through Anthropic’s Agent SDK. Antigravity requests run
through Google’s official, signed-in `agy` CLI. Account permissions, model
availability and subscription limits still apply.

## Quick start

For the released **Claude** backend, install [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/), then:

```sh
npm install -g @rynfar/meridian
claude login
meridian
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3456`. For OpenCode V1, run `meridian setup` and restart
OpenCode. For Pi and other clients, follow the [client setup guide](docs/agents.md).
See [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for API-key protection and Windows
setup, or [deployment](docs/deployment.md) for Docker and Nix.

## Try Antigravity

**Antigravity is available on the published feature branch, not in the current npm
release.** [PR #1074](https://github.com/rynfar/meridian/pull/1074) tracks the work.
The verified setup uses **agy 1.2.7**, **Pi 0.72.1** or **OpenCode V1 1.18.31**,
and macOS on Apple Silicon. Other versions need their own verification.

Install Node.js 22+, [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and the
[official Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/). Run `agy` to sign in with
your subscription account and disable paid overage credits in its settings.
Then build the preview:

```sh
git clone --branch feat/antigravity-backend https://github.com/rynfar/meridian.git meridian-antigravity
cd meridian-antigravity
bun install --frozen-lockfile
npm run build

MERIDIAN_BACKEND=antigravity \
MERIDIAN_AGY_ALLOW_TOOL_BRIDGE=1 \
MERIDIAN_AGY_STATE_PATH="$HOME/.local/state/meridian/antigravity.sqlite" \
MERIDIAN_PORT=3457 \
node dist/cli.js
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3457/providers` and use **Connect Pi / OpenCode**, or follow
the [CLI setup instructions](docs/antigravity.md#configure-installed-clients).
The tool bridge lets the client execute tools with its own permissions. The
SQLite path enables saved state across service restarts; it does not guarantee
recovery of an unfinished action.

### What works

- **The coding loop:** incremental text, client tools, parallel tool batches,
  approvals, questions, cancellation and client-owned plugins/delegation.
- **Model and output selection:** available model/effort variants, forced tools
  and validated structured output.
- **Client APIs:** Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions and a documented
  Responses subset.
- **Attachments:** images and public HTTPS image URLs; documents, speech and
  video through local conversion. These are not native media APIs.
- **Continuity:** warm conversation reuse, eligible completed-session restoration,
  history replay and bounded recovery of saved answers and tool IDs.
- **Provider management:** web and macOS setup, separate quota/status displays,
  shared navigation and activity. Native browser/subagent access requires
  separate explicit grants.

### What is unfinished

Active-task reattachment and automatic reconciliation of uncertain tool outcomes
are unfinished. Some provider-specific plugins, hosted-tool/file contracts and
client versions need adapters and acceptance tests. Authenticated Linux/Windows
verification is also outstanding.

The CLI does not expose exact output-token caps, numeric thinking budgets,
sampling controls or every native media/reasoning feature. Meridian cannot add
those guarantees through a wrapper. Upstream CLI failures can still interrupt a
turn. The [support and recovery checklist](docs/antigravity-support.md) records
what is missing, available workarounds and what would close each gap.

## Desktop

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/desktop-dashboard.jpg" alt="Meridian Desktop showing usage limits, cache activity and recent requests. Sample data." width="1000" />
</p>
<p align="center"><sub>macOS dashboard preview · Sample data</sub></p>

The optional Mac app manages the local service, versions, plugins and diagnostics.
Use **Providers** to navigate Claude and Antigravity; their accounts and quota
windows stay separate. Request history helps track failures and activity across
the service.

The desktop preview targets **macOS on Apple Silicon**. The first downloadable
release is being prepared; use the [source instructions](apps/desktop/README.md#run-locally)
in the meantime. To try Antigravity, connect the app to the preview service built
above. Installing the current npm release from **Versions** does not install the
Antigravity branch.

Headless use remains supported. The npm package does not install Electron;
Docker, Nix and existing service managers can run the same server.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/how-it-works.svg" alt="Pi, OpenCode and other supported clients connect to Meridian. Claude uses the Agent SDK; Antigravity uses the official agy CLI. Each provider uses its own signed-in account." width="920" />
</p>

Meridian translates supported client requests at the provider boundary. It keeps
Claude-specific account routing and cache behavior separate from Antigravity’s
CLI sessions and permissions. Antigravity generation stays on the signed-in CLI;
there is no Google API-key or model-SDK fallback.
